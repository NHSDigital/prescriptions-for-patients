  'Prescriber Approved' means the item is ready to be dispensed.
  'With Pharmacy' means the item has been downloaded by the pharmacy
    but is not ready to collect.
  'Ready to Collect' means the pharmacy has prepared the prescription
    item and it's ready to collect.
  'Dispatched' means the pharmacy has prepared the prescription item
    and it has been dispatched for delivery.
  'Collected' means that the patient or patient carer has collected
