  * 'Prescriber Approved' means the item is ready to be dispensed.
  * 'Prescriber Cancelled' means the item has been cancelled by the prescriber, can be included in a prescription 
    where other items have not been cancelled. Patient should be advised to contact prescriber to find out 
    the reason for cancellation.
  * 'With Pharmacy' means the item has been downloaded by the pharmacy
    but is not ready to collect.
  * 'With Pharmacy but Tracking not Supported' means that we do not have prescription tracking data for
    the prescription, possibly because the pharmacy is not using a
    dispensing system which is onboarded to the NPPT service.
  * 'With Pharmacy - Preparing Remainder' means the prescription has been partially dispensed, 
    but the remaining medication is still with the pharmacy to prepare and dispense.

    item and it's ready to collect.

    medication is still with the pharmacy to prepare and dispense.
  * 'Ready to Dispatch' means the prescription is in a holding area ready for collection by a delivery courier. 
    This status will be set based on activity triggered by the pharmacy dispensing process. This might be the scanning 
    of the prescription package bar code or another action performed only against those items when they are placed 
    in a holding area.
  * 'Ready to Dispatch - Partial' means the prescription is in a holding area ready for collection by a delivery courier.
